# Smart Contract Project
This Solidity program is a assessment program that deploy on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates basic functionalities of a cryptocurrency token, which includes declaring, mininting and burning tokens and also with the basic safety checks.

## Description
SmartContractProject is a simple Solidity smart contract that showcases the use of 'require()', 'assert()', and 'revert()' methods that are used for error handling in Solidity. It also includes functions for setting and resetting a value, ensuring only the contract owner can perform certain actions, and checking conditions using 'assert()' method. In this, 'require()' method is used for validate certain condition before further execution of a function, 'assert()' method is used for checking the condition whether it is true or false and 'revert()' method is used reset or revert the current call.

## Getting Started
### Installing
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/AbhayKejriwal04/MetaCrafter-ETH-AVAXPROOF/blob/92fc072d54bf76a355e62519263766495ff8470e/Functions%26Error(Module1)%20Assessment
```

2) Ensure you have the necessary developmemt environment for Solidity like Remix IDE.You can use Remix as it is an online IDE for Solidity. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
   
4) Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., SmartContractPrj.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file which has been provided in the ETH-AVAXPROOF repository under the name Function&Error (Module 1) Assessment.

### Executing Program
To compile and deploy the Smart Contract Project:
1) Open the file SmartContractPrj in Remix IDE.
2) On the left side the taskbar Solidity Compiler icon is there, click on it and then click on ``Compile SmartContractPrj.sol``.
3) On the same taskbar there Deploy and Run Transacrtion icon, click on it and then click on the `Deploy` option.
4) Put the _new value in the set function after deploying it and then click on the check and get fucntion simultaneously for first checking the value and then getting the result afterwards.
5) After getting the value then click on the reset function to reset the value to 0.
